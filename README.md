# HR Analytics Dashboard for Employee Attrition

## Problem Statement
The company was experiencing a significant increase in employee attrition, which was inflating hiring and training costs. The goal of this project was to analyze employee data and create a Power BI dashboard to uncover the reasons behind the high attrition rates. The insights derived would help formulate strategies to enhance employee retention.
## Key Findings
The analysis identified several critical factors contributing to employee attrition:
#### Pending Promotions:
Employees who had not received promotions were more likely to leave.
#### Distance from Home:
Employees living farther from the workplace exhibited higher attrition rates.
#### Pending Applications for Increments: 
Unprocessed increment requests led to employee dissatisfaction and turnover.
#### Age Diversity: 
There was a notable resistance among older employees to accept new ideas and perspectives from younger colleagues, creating a challenging work environment.
## Retention Strategies Formulated
Based on the key findings, several retention strategies were proposed:
#### Training and Integration: 
Invest in training programs that integrate new software and technologies for both young and aging employees. This would help bridge the technological gap and foster a more collaborative environment.
#### Travel Allowances: 
Provide travel allowances to employees who commute long distances to alleviate the burden and improve their work-life balance.
#### Promotion Review: 
Conduct thorough reviews of employees pending for promotions to ensure deserving candidates are recognized and promoted timely.
#### Increment Application Review: 
Assess the profiles of employees who have requested increments, analyze their skill sets against market standards, and prioritize processing increments for those who deserve them. Additionally, offer upskilling training programs to align employeesâ€™ skills with expected increments.
### Steps Taken to Create the Project
#### Data Cleaning: 
The first step involved cleaning the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
#### Data Export to Power BI: 
The cleaned data was then exported to Power BI Desktop for further analysis.
#### Power Query Customization: 
Using Power Query, necessary columns were customized and added to the dataset to enrich the analysis.
#### DAX Measures: 
Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) were written to create calculated measures, providing deeper insights.
#### Dashboard Creation: 
An insightful dashboard was developed in Power BI, visualizing key metrics and findings. This dashboard facilitated easy interpretation of the data and supported informed decision-making.
## Conclusion
The HR Analytics Dashboard project successfully identified key factors driving employee attrition and formulated actionable strategies to mitigate these issues. By implementing the proposed retention strategies, the company can reduce attrition rates, lower hiring and training costs, and foster a more engaged and stable workforce. The Power BI dashboard serves as a powerful tool for ongoing monitoring and management of employee retention efforts.
